SQL - 



What is a test failur and what is code failure - what are 
the difference betwen them 

- test fail - assertions failur - defect 
expected vs actual 


- code fail - we could not execute the test - 


TestNG - Traditional frameowork , Junit 

TDD - test driven development 
All the web interaction - selenium
test framework - create report, suite, data driven testing, create
sequence for our test 

Cucumber - BDD - behaviour driven development 

1. testing the behaviour of the application 
2. to make your tests accessiible to technical and non-technical
persons of the team 
technical side - test script 

non-techinal side - gherkin language 


gherkin language - java/selenium

feature file - non technical file written with gherkin language

step definition file - technical/java file that executes the test 

test runner - test suite, creating a result 

cucumeber setup 

1. need to have all the jar files to build path 
2. install the cucumber eclipse plugin
