Selenium Setup - Role of selenium 

Selenium - Library - java library 

functions already created that we are going to use - 

packages - non runnable class - functions and properties 

5 packages - 100 non runnable class - 1000 functions and properties 

jar file - selenium java 
selenium server standalone - selenium webdriver 

selenium - interact with a browser - web based application 

90 percent of the application - 

Setting up selenium - 

1. setting up the libraries - jar files - maven repository 

2. browser driver - chrome, mozila, safari , IE

functions - how to use functions 
how to create and how to use 
what to learn : 
2-3 
1. Java - OOP 

2. Selenium Libraries -  

actual value - test scripts 
expected value - requirments 

actual value and expected values are same - test case pass - test
if not same - test case fail - requirements 




What we do in automated test scripts: 3 categories 

1. interacting with browser - webdriver 

2. finding web elements - loacting techniques 
text box - type something you need value - type
button - click
check box - click
radio button - click
links - click
drop down menu - select

table
javascript pop up
windows 

3. interacting with the web elements
