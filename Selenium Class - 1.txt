Good Morning

What is computer programming? 

set of instructions - language 
open folder
find a file
open the file 
read the file 


language - Java 

machine language - 01010101000111


high level programming language - java, python, C#, c, c++, javascript

setting up environment 

1. java compiler - jdk 
java core library + jre 
java runtime environment 

jre - is required to run any java software or code in a machine 

java core library - required to write any code in java - source code

2. .java - command 

javac test.java 

intelligent editor - IDE - integrated development enviroment 

Eclipse IDE for java developers 

int x = 78; 

x = 78;
workspace - 

11:35






Starting to write Code - 

1. data - way to store data 
2. logic - set of instructions to solve a problem 

class - is the basic unit of java 

I have to create a class - 

package - a java folder 

we can not rename a class
class - 
.java 
.class

Runnable class - the class you can run 
main method in the class

non-runnable class - class you cant run 


public class nameoftheclass { 
    
     public static void main (String args[]){




}




}













java stores data - 

x = 15
x=16
y=bob
variable

datatype 

number, name, 

whole number 

integer 

int x = 76;

int y = 10.54;

double z = 12.12;

String name = "df hjjhd";

boolean test = true/false; 

char c = 'a';






datatype variable = value of the variable; 

int x = 12;

String y = "dfdjfl";

double z = 65.87; 

boolean test = true/false; 

2 steps process 
declaring the varible
int x ; 

 the variable - 

variable x y z a b c 

int num1

int x ; 

declaring the variable 
int num1; 

num1 is an integer type of variable 

num1=12; 

String name ; declaring 

name = "Michael"; initializing

String name = "Michael";

int amountOfMoney; 
int AmountOfMoney; 
amountOfMoney = 1200; 

case - sensitive language 

car price - 

car price + admin fee + interest rate + tax = total car price

60 

total car price / 60
